# APA Style Reference for Statistical Notation
This is a reference for APA 7 statistical notation style, according to the Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association. I was unable to find this information online and the [APA website](www.apastyle.apa.org) only provides a short reference document for [Numbers and Statistics](https://apastyle.apa.org/instructional-aids/numbers-statistics-guide.pdf) that ultimately references the book. I wanted to make this information available so that myself and others could reference it for journal articles and document publications that would satisfy the most recent statistical style and notation for APA 7.
