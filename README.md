# APA Style Reference for Statistical Notation
This is a reference for APA 7 statistical notation style, according to the Publication Manual of the American Psychological Assocation (ISBN: 9781433832154). I was unable to find this information online and the (APA website)[www.apastyle.apa.org] only provides a short reference document for (Numbers and Statistics)[https://apastyle.apa.org/instructional-aids/numbers-statistics-guide.pdf].

The Statistical Abbreviations and Symbols file summarizes Table 6.5 from this book. _Note_ I used excel's "table from picture" feature so if you notice an error I didn't catch, feel free to reach out and let me know.
